[X] Module samples have a default volume.
    [X] When a note is played without an explicit volume,
        the channel volume is set to the sample's "default"
[X] Handle multiple channels in a pattern.
[X] Correct handling of "set speed"
[X] Implement volume slide effect.
[X] Implement pitch slide (slide up, slide down, portamento)
[X] BUG: When none looping sample ends, channel needs to be deactivated
[X] LERP to 0 at end of non-looping sample
[X] Implement portamento + volume slide
[X] Portamento can handle higher speeds
[X] BUG: Dont't set speed if data is 0 (it pauses playback indefinitely)
[X] Implement vibrato effect
[X] Implement vibrato effect + volume slide
[X] Integrate S3M loader from branch 
[X] Implement sample offset effect (O)
[X] Detect file loader based on extension
[X] Integrate Impulse Tracker loader from branch
[ ] Update frames per tick when tempo change command is reached (How do we test?)
[ ] Maybe silo frequency based effects in prep for handling amiga/linear effects modes
    [ ] We output frequency, so working with 'periods' is presumably secondary.
    [ ] Effects that change periods ultimately affect frequency, but not the other
        * It may come down to a boolean on whether frequency derives from period or no
        way around. (i.e. We shouldn't expect a frequency change to update a period)
[ ] Create period -> frequency relationship for Amiga based pitch effects
[ ] Portamento/Instrument change (sample sets back to 0)
[ ] Verify validity of S3M and throw error otherwise (crashes now)
[ ] Create loader "txt"
[ ] Mixer post-processing (divide by channel count?)
[ ] Fix iterator related bugs in parsing patterns (Manifested on Windows)
[ ] Fix empty sample loading bug (Manifested on Windows)
[ ] Update LERP function
