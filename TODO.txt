        the channel volume is set to the sample's "default"
[X] Handle multiple channels in a pattern.
[X] Correct handling of "set speed"
[X] Implement volume slide effect.
[X] Implement pitch slide (slide up, slide down, portamento)
[X] BUG: When none looping sample ends, channel needs to be deactivated
[ ] LERP to 0 at end of non-looping sample
[ ] Create loader "txt"
[ ] Integrate S3M loader from branch
    [ ] Verify validity of S3M and throw error otherwise (crashes now)
[ ] Integrate Impulse Tracker loader from branch
[ ] Implement vibrato effect
[ ] Portamento can handle values greater than 7Fh
[ ] Mixer post-processing (divide by channel count?)
[ ] Detect file loader based on extension
